    "## Key Results\n",
    "- **Personalized Recommendations**: The hybrid recommendation system combines:\n",
    "  - **Collaborative Filtering (SVD)**: Uncovers latent user-book interactions with high accuracy.\n",
    "  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Uses TF-IDF and cosine similarity to recommend books based on title similarity, achieving relevant suggestions.\n",
    "  - **Popularity-Based Filtering**: Provides robust fallback recommendations for cold-start scenarios.\n",
    "- **Model Performance**: Evaluated using RMSE on a sample of the ratings dataset, demonstrating effective prediction of user preferences (RMSE details depend on dataset size, typically competitive with industry benchmarks).\n",
    "- **User Insights**: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed:\n",
    "  - Distribution of ratings, highlighting user engagement patterns.\n",
    "  - Top-rated books, such as *The Lovely Bones* and *The Da Vinci Code*.\n",
    "  - User demographics and activity levels, with visualizations like heatmaps and PCA plots.\n",
    "- **Interactive Deployment**: A Streamlit web app enables users to select a User ID or Book Title, view tailored recommendations, and evaluate model performance in real-time, requiring no web development expertise.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: The modular architecture is adaptable to other domains (e.g., movies, music, e-commerce), showcasing versatility."
