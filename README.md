# ðŸ“š ml-book-recommender

**Personalized, hybrid book recommendation system using collaborative filtering, NLP-based content similarity, and popularity-based models â€” deployed via an interactive Streamlit web app.**

---

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

Discovering the right book can be overwhelming with millions of titles available. **`ml-book-recommender`** solves this by delivering highly personalized book suggestions based on user preferences, book content, and global popularity trends.

This end-to-end machine learning project combines:

- âœ… Collaborative Filtering (SVD)
- âœ… Natural Language Processing (TF-IDF + cosine similarity)
- âœ… Popularity-based logic

Inspired by real-world systems used by **Amazon**, **Goodreads**, and **Netflix**, this project showcases full-stack data science skills from data ingestion to deployment.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** â€“ Books, users, and ratings datasets cleaned, deduplicated, and validated.
- **Collaborative Filtering (SVD)** â€“ Learns hidden userâ€“book patterns for personalized recommendations.
- **Content-Based Filtering** â€“ Suggests similar books using TF-IDF and cosine similarity on title and metadata.
- **Popularity-Based Model** â€“ Recommends most-rated books as a cold-start fallback.
- **Hybrid Recommendation System** â€“ Combines all three approaches for enhanced accuracy and diversity.
- **Evaluation Metrics** â€“ RMSE for collaborative filtering performance.
- **Interactive Web UI** â€“ Built with Streamlit for real-time recommendations and model insights.
- **Data Visualizations** â€“ Heatmaps, PCA plots, demographic insights, and rating distributions.
